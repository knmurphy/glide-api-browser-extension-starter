# Glide API Browser Extension Starter

This is a starter project for building a browser extension that interacts with the Glide API. I hope you use it to build something amazing! I made it because browser extensions are super useful but way too tedious for most to build without some starter code.

## Features (Coming Soon)

- [ ] Setting Glide API Tokens
- [ ] Setting Glide API App Base URL
- [ ] Setting Glide Table ID
- [ ] Add Row
- [ ] Update Row
- [ ] Delete Row [Requires Glide Business Plan]
- [ ] Get Row [Requires Glide Business Plan]
- [ ] Sending update via Webhooks instead of API Calls

## Getting Started (nothing working yet)

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the project
